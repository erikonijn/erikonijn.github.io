Incredibly inspirational quote from Tommy Wiseau ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2zdzik/tommy_wiseau_creator_of_the_room_and_the_new_tv/cpi0off/)). Tommy Wiseau, if you didn't know, is the star of and visionary genius/vampire of the classic *The Room (2003)*. It's probably the best accidental comedy ever made. If you haven't watched it, go watch it now.
