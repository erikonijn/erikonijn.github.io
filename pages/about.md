## what?

This site is for things I make when I make them.

## when?

I don't really have a schedule. There might be hours between content, there might be months.

## how?

I use Adobe Photoshop for making photos and Premiere Pro/After Effects for making videos. My computer runs Windows 10 on an i5-4460k and a Radeon R9-280x with 8 gb RAM.

This website was written in Brackets and runs on Jekyll.

## why?

Why not?
