## who?

Me. Young kiddo with an interest in photo manipulation, design, filmmaking, programming, web dev, video editing, playing music, and so forth.

## what?

This site is to showcase some things I make when I make them.

## when?

I don't really have a schedule. There might be hours between content, there might be months.

## how?

I use Adobe Photoshop or (rarely Illustrator) for making designs and Premiere Pro/After Effects for editing my videos. Sometimes AE for design stuff too. My DAW of choice is Ableton but I prefer Audition for general audio editing I think.

My workstation is a Windows 10 pc with a Ryzen 7 3700x and a Radeon R9-280x with 16 gb RAM.

This website was written in Brackets and runs on Jekyll.

## why?

That's a stupid question and you know it.
