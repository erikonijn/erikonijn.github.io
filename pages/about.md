[**erik konijn**](/)

I'm Erik. I've done basically everything under the media sun at this point: filmmaking, music, audio, video editing, cinematography, visual design, web development, writing & scriptwriting, etc....

I'm self taught in many things - I studied film in Denmark (at the European Film College) + media in Ireland (at the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Tech).

I taught myself to produce & mix music and audio during 2021-2023 and have been working as freelance producer & audio engineer.

I was born & raised in Luxembourg with Danish & Dutch parents (I speak English + Danish + Dutch + German).
