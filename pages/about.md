[**erik konijn**](/)

I'm Erik. I've done basically everything under the media sun at this point: filmmaking, music, audio, video editing, cinematography, visual design, web development, writing & scriptwriting, etc....

I'm self taught in many things - I studied film in Denmark (at the European Film College) + media in Ireland (at the Dun Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Tech).

I've taught myself to produce & mix music and audio over 2021-2024, and have been working as freelance producer & audio engineer (mix/master/etc. see my credits [here](/credits)).

I was born & raised in Luxembourg with Danish & Dutch parents (I speak English + Danish + Dutch + German).
