**IADT Portfolio 2021-2025**

Below you can find a showcase of some of my work made at IADT Dun Laoghaire in the New Media Studies course, 2021-2025.

***Finding Yourself in the Light of the Screen* (Final Year Project, 2025)**

This video essay was my Final Year Project - my thesis if you will. It explores how the films of Jane Schoenbrun wrestle with the concepts of technology, identity and the screen, through analysing their films *A Self-Induced Hallucination* (2018), *We're All Going to the World's Fair* (2021) and *I Saw the TV Glow* (2024).

***When I Get Rich* (Short Film, 2023)**

A short comedy film I wrote & directed for a Media Production course in my 2nd year, about a busker with big dreams. I also wrote the original song, isn't it great?

***Showtime!* (Short Film, 2022)**

A short drama-comedy thing I write & directed in my first year, about two aspiring actors whose ambitions come to a head on stage... Also a fun exercise in lighting and framing!

***Fanzine: Foxygen* (2021)**

A 14-page fanzine I designed for a Music Industries class in my first year. Still really proud of how this came together! Click [here](/assets/fanzine.pdf) or on the image to download...
